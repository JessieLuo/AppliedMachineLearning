## Overview

### Execution Instruction

SVM:

Uncomment model training code to get own parameters, or download the saved model parameter from URL on repo.

Bi-LSTMs:

Run the code on colab GPU (Personally use A100). If training the model, do not use the model.load_model(). If want to use trained model, also download from url and comment the training code(but retain the initializer).

CNNs:

Same as Bi-LSTMs
